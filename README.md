   ![Yes](setup_images/image-19.png)

# 5. **Install Dependencies**

1. Install requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirementsW.txt
   ```

2. Verify CUDA installation:
   ```
   python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
   ```

   Successful output should look like:

   ![GPUs](setup_images/image-20.png)

   *Note: An empty list ([]) indicates TensorFlow is not detecting the GPU.*

# 6. **Configure Training File**

1. Open the train_cnn_v3.py file
2. Update the dataset paths to where you installed them, for example:

   ![FilePaths](setup_images/image-2.png)

If using TensorBoard, logs will be available in /data2/logs/. Once training is complete, the trained model weights will be stored in /data2/models/.



# Linux instructions:

## Check Prerequisites:

## Open Terminal
* Press Ctrl + Alt + T to open a terminal window

* Or find "Terminal" in your system's application menu

## Install Git
First, we'll install Git:

```
sudo apt update
```

```
sudo apt install git
```

```
git --version  
```
(verify it has installed successfully)

## Check/install GPU drivers

*	Next, check if you have the required NVIDIA drivers installed:

```
nvidia-smi
```

You should see something like this:

![GPUInfo](setup_images/Linux5.PNG)

This shows your GPU information. If you see this and you see a driver verion greater than 450.80.02, you can skip the following steps. 

* If you don’t see something similar to the above image you’ll need to install NVIDIA drivers: 

```
sudo apt update
```
```
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535
```
**Note:** Depending on your GPU model and Linux distribution, you might need a different driver version. You can check available versions with:
```
ubuntu-drivers devices
```
**Note:** For compatibility with CUDA 11.2 and TensorFlow 2.10, you need a NVIDIA driver version at least greater than 450.80.02.  


## Installing Miniconda:

* Create/navigate to a directory for your miniconda installation
*Example:*

```
mkdir ~/Downloads
```
```
cd ~/Downloads
```
* Install Miniconda:

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py310_24.9.2-0-Linux-x86_64.sh

```
```
chmod +x Miniconda3-py310_24.9.2-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
```
./Miniconda3-py310_24.9.2-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
* Press enter when prompted (hold enter key to scroll through terms and conditions)

![Miniconda](setup_images/Linux1.PNG)
 

* When you get to the end type “yes” and press enter when prompted

![Miniconda2](setup_images/Linux2.PNG)

It will say something like: 

"Confirm the installation location: 

Miniconda3 will now be installed into this location:
/home/your_username/miniconda3

  - Press ENTER to confirm the location
  - Press CTRL-C to abort the installation
  - Or specify a different location below

"

* As the message indicates, you can choose to paste a separate path or press enter to confirm the current default installation location. 

* When prompted, type “no” into the terminal. 
 
 
![Miniconda3](setup_images/Linux3.PNG)

* It should now say “Thank you for installing Miniconda3!” 
 
* Verify Miniconda has been successfully installed by typing the command:
```
/home/your_username/miniconda3/bin/conda –-version
```
*(make sure to replace with your specific path)*

* You should see a version number like “conda 24.9.2” which indicates Miniconda has been successfully installed

# Conda Environment Creation/Activation

* Now we need to create a new conda environment using Python 3.10

Type 
```
/home/your_username/miniconda3/bin/conda create -n galaxies python=3.10

```
*(replace with your path)*

Type “y” and then enter when prompted

* Next we need to activate the environment. 

Type:

```
source /home/your_username/miniconda3/bin/activate galaxies
```
*(replace with your actual path to your miniconda3 folder)*

and press enter

* You should now see “galaxies” in front of your terminal, indicating the environment has been successfully activated 

*Example:*

![GalaxiesEnv](setup_images/Linux4.PNG)

## Installing CUDA and cuDNN

* Next we need to install the compatible CUDA and cudNN versions for this project

Type:
```
/home/your_username/miniconda3/bin/conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1
```
* Type "y" when prompted and press enter


* CUDA and cuDNN should now successfully be installed, to confirm type:
``` 
nvcc --version
```
which should return a CUDA version.

## Cloning the Repository
* Now we need to clone the GitHub repo

* If you are in the miniconda3 folder, navigate out of it to an appropriate folder to clone the repo, for example: 
```
cd /home/your_username/downloads
```

* Next, type git clone (HTTPS link to repo) for example: 
```
git clone https://github.com/astrodatalab/galaxiesml_examples.git
```
* Then navigate into the directory

```
cd galaxiesml_examples
```

## Installing Requirements
**NOTE:** *Very important!* 

For the below step, make sure to type "requirementsL.txt" NOT "requirementsW.txt".

The "W" stands for Windows while the "L" stands for Linux, and they have different package versions. If you attempt to install the Windows requirementsW.txt you will run into errors.

* Type 
 
```
/shared/jacob_software/miniconda3/bin/pip install -r requirementsL.txt
```

* Now verify that Tensorflow is working correctly
```
 python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
 ```
* This should return "2.10.0"

* Next we need to verify that CUDA is properly configured 

Type: 

``` 
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
```
It should return a message that looks something like this: 

![GPUTF](setup_images/Linux6.PNG)

If you just have empty brackets "[ ]" it indicated Cuda has not been successfully installed/configured

## Training the CNN
 
 * Now you will need to adjust the paths in the train_cnn_v3.py script to where you have installed the datasets, for example:

 ![Paths](setup_images/Datasets.PNG)

* You can also adjust hyperparameters here if you wish, however this is optional

### Training Parameters:
- **--image_size**: Set to 64 or 127 depending on the dataset you downloaded
- **--epochs**: Number of training epochs (default: 200)
- **--batch_size**: Number of samples per training batch (default: 256)
- **--learning_rate**: Learning rate for training (default: 0.0001)

 * Save the file, then go back to your terminal
 
 Type:

 ```
 python train_cnn_v3.py
```
 
Training progress will be displayed in the terminal, including loss values and other metrics. Checkpoints will be saved automatically during training to the specified directory (default:data2/)
